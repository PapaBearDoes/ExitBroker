# ExitBroker
## One Click Forced Exit/Logout/Reload UI button for Broker
ExitBroker used to be known as Broker_Exit, but then Twitch then took over Curse, and I lost access to my old account, so I've had to rename the addon to be able to publish it to you guys.  

## Addon
I found the lack of an LDB logout/reload/forced-exit button to be a royal pain after playing with Broker a bit and replacing all my FuBar addons with LDB compliant ones. Thus ExitBroker was coded.

### Options
It's very small, very simplistic, and to me very helpful. It provides a one click availability to reload, exit or logout right on your LDB display.  

You will need an LDB display addon (such as ChocolateBar) for this to be useful to you.  

Usage:  
*&lt;Left Click&gt;* on the icon: Reloads your UI.  
**&lt;SHIFT&gt;** + *&lt;Left Click&gt;*: Logs you out of the game.  
***&lt;CONTROL&gt;*** + *&lt;Left Click&gt;*: Forced Exit (No confirmation, just saves your addon data and exits the game).
